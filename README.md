# ChaCha20-with-Poly1305
This project demonstrates the implementation of a cryptographic system combining ChaCha20 encryption and Poly1305 authentication. It provides a robust and secure mechanism to encrypt, authenticate, decrypt, and verify data. The system ensures both confidentiality and integrity, ideal for real-world secure communication.
